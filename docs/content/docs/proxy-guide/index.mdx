Proxying Rybbit's tracking script through your own domain helps bypass ad blockers and improves tracking accuracy by making all analytics requests appear as first-party traffic.

## What is Proxy Setup?

When you add Rybbit's tracking script directly to your website using the default installation:

```html
<script src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js" async data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"></script>
```

The browser loads the script from `app.rybbit.io`, which ad blockers can identify and block as third-party analytics. Even though Rybbit is privacy-focused and doesn't use cookies, some ad blockers use aggressive blocking rules that target any analytics domains.

**Proxying solves this** by serving the tracking script and handling tracking requests through your own domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com/analytics/script.js`), making all tracking appear as first-party traffic.

Rybbit is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. It uses cookieless tracking based on IP + User Agent hashing with optional daily rotating salts. Proxying is about improving data accuracy, not circumventing privacy laws.

## Why Proxy Rybbit?

### Improve Tracking Accuracy

Ad blockers are becoming increasingly aggressive and may block analytics scripts regardless of their privacy practices. By proxying through your own domain:

- **Bypass ad blocker detection**: Requests appear as first-party traffic to your own domain
- **Increase data completeness**: Typical improvement of 10-30% in tracked sessions
- **Maintain accurate metrics**: Get a true picture of your website's performance

### Stay Privacy-Compliant

Proxying doesn't compromise user privacy:

- No cookies are used (Rybbit remains cookieless)
- User data is still processed according to your privacy policy
- GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations remain fully satisfied
- Users can still opt out through browser settings or Do Not Track

### Better Performance (Optional)

With proper caching configuration, proxying can also improve performance:

- Serve scripts from your CDN or edge network
- Reduce DNS lookups (one less domain to resolve)
- Cache static scripts closer to your users

## How It Works

Here's the flow when you proxy Rybbit:

1. **User visits your website**: Your HTML includes the tracking script from your domain
   ```html
   <script src="https://yourdomain.com/analytics/script.js" data-site-id="123"></script>
   ```

2. **Script loads from your domain**: Your server proxies the request to Rybbit's servers
   - Request: `yourdomain.com/analytics/script.js` → proxied to → `app.rybbit.io/api/script.js`

3. **Script auto-discovers analytics host**: The Rybbit script automatically detects the domain it was loaded from
   ```typescript
   // The script extracts the host from its own src attribute
   const analyticsHost = src.split("/script.js")[0];
   // Result: "https://yourdomain.com/analytics"
   ```

4. **Tracking data sent through your domain**: All analytics events are sent to your domain and proxied to Rybbit
   - Event tracking: `yourdomain.com/analytics/track` → proxied to → `app.rybbit.io/api/track`
   - Session replay: `yourdomain.com/analytics/session-replay/record/{siteId}` → proxied
   - Configuration: `yourdomain.com/analytics/site/tracking-config/{siteId}` → proxied

5. **Data appears in your Rybbit dashboard**: No changes needed in the Rybbit interface

<Callout type="warn">
**Bandwidth Consideration**: All tracking requests will flow through your server infrastructure, which will increase bandwidth usage. For most sites this is minimal (typically 10-50KB per session), but consider this when evaluating hosting costs.
